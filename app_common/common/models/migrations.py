'''
Package for performing database migrations.

Files located in the 'migrations' directory under each micro service may contain database migration code. The files must be named in
the format: YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS  So, for example, 2016-04-19-14-13-00

Files are run in order, according to the timestamp represented by the file name, and then recorded in the database so that the same
file is not run again. The name format recorded is: <service-name>/<filename> so migrations are scoped by service name.
