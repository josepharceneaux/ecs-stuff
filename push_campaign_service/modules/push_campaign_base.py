"""
This module contain PushCampaignVase class which is sub class of CampaignBase.

    PushCampaignBase class contains method that do following actions:
        - __init__():
            Constructor calls supper method to initialize default values for a push campaign

        - get_all_campaigns():
            This method retrieves all push campaigns from getTalent push_campaign table.

        - schedule():
            This method schedules a campaign using Scheduler Service

        - pre_process_celery_task():
            This method is used to transform data required for celery tasks to run on.
            In this case, it is creating a list of candidate_ids from candidates,
            as SQLAlchemy objects do not behave well across different sessions.

        - send_campaign_to_candidate():
            This method is core of the whole service. It receives a candidate id,
            retrieves candidate and campaign object using self.campaign_id. It then creates a
            blast and after sending the campaign, updates blast object with campaign stats.

        - callback_campaign_sent():
            This method is invoked when campaign has been sent to all associated campaigns.
            This method creates activity for campaign sent.

        - celery_error_handler():
            This method is invoked if some error occurs during sending a campaign
            in celery task. It then rollbacks that transaction. (Celery task has it's own scoped session)
