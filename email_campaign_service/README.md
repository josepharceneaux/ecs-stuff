# Email Campaign Service
*Flask micro service for handling the email marketing related stuff.*

##### Documentation
API Documentation is available on [apiary.io](http://docs.emailcampaignservice.apiary.io/)

##### Email Id used in tests
When using fake from and reply_to addresses in tests, emails were being delivered a bit late.
To resolve that, a new gmail id was created which is used in from and reply_to fields in tests only.
Email ID: test.gettalent@gmail.com
Password: Test@!@#
